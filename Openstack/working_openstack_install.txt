DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS OF INSTALL

Pre-requisites
Add the OpenStack installer ppa to your system.

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cloud-installer/stable
$ sudo apt-get update
Note: The host system must be capable of supporting KVM and nested KVM.

Hardware
The installer would work best with at least:

12G RAM (Hard requirement, see note below.)
100G HDD (SSD for optimal performance)
8 CPUs
Note: If running on a system with less than 12G of RAM expect to run into deployment issues early. Currently, 12G is the absolute lowest one can go to ensure a deployment will succeed.

Installation
Install the OpenStack installer via apt-get

$ sudo apt-get install openstack
Start the installation
To start the installation run the following command

$ sudo openstack-install
An initial dialog box will appear asking you to select which type of install, choose Single system.

Setting a password

When asked to set the OpenStack password it should be noted that this password is used throughout all OpenStack related services (ie Horizon login password).

Installing of Services
The installer will run through a series of steps starting with making sure the necessary bits are available for a single system installation and ending with a juju bootstrapped system.

When the bootstrapping has finished it will immediately load the status screen. From there you can see the nodes listed along with the deployed charms necessary to start your private OpenStack cloud.

Adding additional compute nodes, block storage, object storage, and controllers can be done by pressing A and making the selection on the dialog box.

Finally, once those nodes are displayed and the charms deployed the horizon dashboard will be available to you for managing your OpenStack cloud.

Logging into Horizon (Openstack Dashboard)
The IP address of Horizon is located at the bottom of the status screen along with your login and password credentials. For example, the login credentials for the dashboard are:

username: ubuntu password: "password that was set during installation"
